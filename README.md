# progresa

This is an analysis on the Progresa program, a government social assistance program in Mexico. This program, as well as the details of its impact, are described in the paper "School subsidies for the poor: evaluating the Mexican Progresa poverty program", by Paul Shultz (available on Canvas). 

The timeline of the program was:

Baseline survey conducted in 1997
Intervention begins in 1998, "Wave 1" of data collected in 1998
"Wave 2 of data" collected in 1999
Evaluation ends in 2000, at which point the control villages were treated.
The data are actual data collected to evaluate the impact of the Progresa program. In this file, each row corresponds to an observation taken for a given child for a given year. There are two years of data (1997 and 1998), and just under 40,000 children who are surveyed in both years.  

An analysis to find the impact of the program starting from looking at the baseline and after the program using standard t-test, regression and DiD.
